	  <h2>We are not in Harlem Anymore!</h2>
          <p>The Wiz is a 1978 American musical adventure fantasy film produced by Universal Pictures and Motown Productions, and released by Universal Pictures on October 24, 1978. A reimagining of L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz featuring an all-black cast, the film was loosely adapted from the 1974 Broadway musical of the same name. It follows the adventures of Dorothy, a shy, twenty-four-year-old Harlem schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy Land of Oz, which resembles a dream version of New York City. Befriended by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man and a Cowardly Lion, she travels through the city to seek an audience with the mysterious Wiz, who they say is the only one powerful enough to send her home.</p>

	      <p>Upon its original theatrical release, the film was a critical and commercial failure, and marked the end of the resurgence of Black People films that began with the blaxploitation movement of the early 1970s.[4][5][6] Despite its initial failure, it became a cult classic among black audiences, Jackson's fanbase, and Oz enthusiasts.[7][8] Certain aspects influenced The Wiz Live!, a live television adaptation of the musical, aired on NBC in 2015.[9]</p>
